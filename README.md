Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app developed is a Weight Tracking App with the following objectives and user needs in mind:

Objective: The main goal of the app is to provide a practical and motivating platform for users to track their daily weight, set and achieve their target weight goals.

User Needs:

Weight Tracking: Users need a convenient way to track their daily weight changes over time.
Goal Setting: Users want to set and record their desired target weight.
User-Friendly Interface: The app should have a user-friendly interface to make weight tracking easy and accessible.
Motivation: Users should be motivated by the app, which should notify them when they reach their goal weight.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the following screens and features were necessary:

Login/Register Screen: To allow users to create accounts or sign in.
Dashboard: Displaying daily weight entries and dates in a grid to visualize weight changes over time.
Add Weight Entry Screen: Allowing users to input their daily weights easily.
Set Goal Weight Screen: Enabling users to set their desired target weight.
Goal Attainment Notification: To notify and recognize users when they reach their goal weight.
UI designs were kept user-centered by:

Prioritizing simplicity and ease of use to cater to users of various fitness levels.
Ensuring a clean and intuitive layout to facilitate navigation.
Including visual cues and notifications to motivate users.
Providing clear input forms for weight entry and goal setting.
Implementing a dashboard for easy data visualization.
The designs were successful as they focused on the core user needs of tracking and achieving weight goals, resulting in an app that's straightforward and motivating for users.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The coding process involved:

Database Design: Creating tables for weight entries, user accounts, and goals.
UI Development: Implementing screens and user interactions using a mobile app development framework.
Backend Logic: Writing code to handle user authentication, weight tracking, and goal attainment.
Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly testing the app for functionality and fixing any issues.
Techniques and strategies included modular coding, error handling, and following best practices. These can be applied in the future to ensure clean, maintainable, and reliable code in any app development project.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The testing process involved:

Unit Testing: Testing individual components and functions.
Integration Testing: Ensuring different parts of the app work together seamlessly.
User Testing: Enlisting users to test the app's usability and provide feedback.
Testing is crucial to identify and resolve issues before users encounter them. It revealed bugs, usability concerns, and helped refine the app's functionality and user experience.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Innovation was required in several areas:

User Motivation: Innovating on how to keep users motivated to achieve their weight goals through notifications and recognition.
Simplicity: Ensuring that the app remains simple and user-friendly while providing essential features.
Data Visualization: Creating an effective dashboard to visualize weight trends and changes over time.
Error Handling: Innovating in how errors and edge cases were handled gracefully to provide a seamless user experience.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was particularly successful in demonstrating knowledge and skills in database design and backend logic. Designing tables to store weight entries, user accounts, and goals required a strong understanding of database systems. Additionally, implementing the backend logic for user authentication, weight tracking, and goal attainment showcased experience in application development and data management. These components were crucial in making the app functional and user-centered.
